# My Daily Coding Journey

This repository is my daily log of coding problems and their solutions. My goal is to consistently solve one problem every day to improve my skills in data structures and algorithms.

---

### 🚀 What's Inside

I'm focused on tackling problems from platforms like *LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces*.

The solutions are primarily written in **Java**, but I might occasionally use other languages like **Python** or **JavaScript** depending on the problem.

### 📁 How It's Organized

Each problem has its own dedicated folder, formatted like `YYYY-MM-DD_Problem_Name`.

Inside each folder, you'll find:

* The problem statement.
* A brief explanation of my approach.
* The final code solution.

### 📈 My Progress

This section serves as a simple log of my progress. I'll update it daily to keep track of my journey.

* **Day 1:** Solved `Two Sum` on LeetCode. It was a good warm-up!
* **Day 2:** Finished the `Mini-Max Sum` problem on HackerRank. Learned about integer overflow.
* **Day 3:** Tackled `Valid Parentheses` from LeetCode. Used a stack data structure for the first time.
